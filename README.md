This project involves a turn based bare bones Pokemon battle between a human player and a computer player. Each trainer has one Pokemon and they take turns attacking each other until one of their hit points (health) reaches zero and they are unable to battle. 

There is an abstract Pokemon class that is extended by two concrete Pokemon classes (Lucario and Mewtwo).

Each Pokemon has a type that makes them stronger, weaker, or neither depending on which type they are fighting against. 

Each Pokemon also has an ArrayList of attacks that the player can choose from. The attacks are of varying strengths and they require a certain amount of power points in order to be used. 

Each player also has access to an item that can be used to positively affect their Pokemon. 

The computer player uses a random number generator to make its decisions and the human player relies on user input to make decisions.
